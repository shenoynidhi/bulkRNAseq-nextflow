### Bulk RNAseq Analysis Pipeline with Nextflow automation

This repository contains a fully reproducible Nextflow automated workflow to analyze bulk RNAseq data. The goal is to apply nextflow automation to an NGS-based pipeline I originally developed for differential expression analysis (DEA), including dataset download, preprocessing, DEA, and visualization.

**Currently under development**
